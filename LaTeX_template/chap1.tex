\section{Concepts}



This work is motivated by the possibility of identifying the formation channels
of binary black holes (BBHs) using a combination of Earth- and space-based GW
detectors~\cite{Sesana:2016ljz,Wong:2018uwb,Cutler:2019krq,Gerosa:2019dbe},
and in particular by the prospect of using eccentricity measurements to distinguish
between two of the main proposed formation
channels~\cite{Nishizawa:2016jji,Breivik:2016ddj,Nishizawa:2016eza}: field and dynamical formation.
